fact-check: The first winter of COVID saw 80,000 deaths in a 4-month period in
  the UK. It remains the deadliest period of the pandemic. The large rise in
  infections during that period stimulated a new set of government-mandated
  social restrictions. Simultaneously, the vaccine rollout was underway from
  December 2020. These conditions created significant growth for anti-COVID
  restrictions and vaccine Telegram groups, where members vented frustration,
  stirred the pot and looked for solidarity in a time of fear, uncertainty and
  personal sacrifice.
