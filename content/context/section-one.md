  Many of the social media posts featured here are quoted directly from their
  source. Where specific false claims have been made, fact-checking information
  is available in the ‘x’ section. General claims without specific allegations
  remain without fact checking. 


  As of April 2024, COVID-19 is mentioned on the death certificate of over 200,000 people in the UK, and we recognise that many of the posts featured in this project may offend some readers. We have selected the posts carefully, and the chosen posts are used as evidence of public distrust. We in no way endorse any of these claims.
