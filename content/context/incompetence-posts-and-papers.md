context: This is a video about claims of Met Police corruption, racism, misogyny
  and incompetence created by British political campaign group, Led By Donkeys.
fact-check: It’s not clear, but the claim that Teresa May had “over 170 files on
  MPs in the ring and lost them” may be referring to the “Dickens Dossier”,
  which was a 1984 dossier of MPs accused as paedophiles. The dossier was handed
  over to the police and was investigated. Under Teresa May’s government, the
  Indepedent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse was announced and was completed in
  2022.
