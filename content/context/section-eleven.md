  For this part of the project, we illustrate how so few of us have an anonymous
  online profile. We took photographs in London, and aimed to find the
  identities of each person in the photographs using private facial recognition
  services, Pimeyes and Facecheck.id. This practice echoes the Met Police and
  other police forces in the UK’s experiments with facial recognition software. 












  Yes, there has been an institutional quest to obtain the personal data of the UK population, but is that a signal of an Orwellian state? Evidence from how private companies obtain and commodify our data suggests that something else might be going on. Our physical and digital likenesses are captured at a level like never before, and our online presence makes us complicit in that. Shoshana Zuboff’s seminal book, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, introduced us to the idea that the behavioural data that stems from our actions are the ‘proprietary behavioural surplus’ of tech companies. The consequences of that practice is beginning to seep into public and regulator consciousness, but in the meantime data about us online makes almost all of us discoverable. The UK government could, and perhaps should, take privacy much more seriously, but they have been ruling over a nation who have ultimately opted out of privacy in their use of private tech companies’ platforms and services.
