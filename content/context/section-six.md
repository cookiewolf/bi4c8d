fact-check: COVID-19 is mentioned on the death certificate of over 200,000
  people in the UK. The Office for National Statistics does not capture data for
  the deaths caused by specific COVID-19 strains, however as Omicron variants
  remain in circulation and since November 2021, itâ€™s likely to be related in
  the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
