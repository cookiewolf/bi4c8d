context: Lockbit 3.0’s ransomware attack on Royal Mail became one of 2023’s most
  high profile attacks in what would be a record year for ransomware payments,
  where $1 billion of payments were recorded worldwide for the first time.
  Unusually, the ransomware group released the full transcript of the private
  chat between Royal Mail and Lockbit which gave rare insight into how these
  negotiations play out. Royal Mail did not give in to the demands, and there’s
  no suggestion from the transcript that a lower offer might’ve been considered.
  After those negotiations broke down, Lockbit 3.0 published the data which
  contained many sensitive files, including contracts and employees’ data.
