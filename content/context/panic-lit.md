  The consequences of 9/11 were felt in numerous ways, from airport security,
  increased surveillance capacities of intelligence agencies and increased
  international collaboration between agencies. Despite the tens of thousands of
  local government operated CCTV cameras in the UK, and many more privately
  owned cameras that can be used by police forces in an investigation, public
  awareness campaigns around suspicious packages and ‘unusual behaviour’ were
  considered vital to enlist the public’s help in fighting terrorism. Is this
  what the public would expect civic duty and a shared responsibility for safety
  to look like? Or did it serve to arouse an atmosphere of fear and suspicion
  with little to no impact on safety?
