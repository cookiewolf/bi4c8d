  UM newspapers - To be Added
fact-check: The consequences of 9/11 were felt in numerous ways, from airport
  security, increased surveillance capacities of intelligence agencies and
  increased international collaboration between agencies. Despite the tens of
  thousands of local government operated CCTV cameras in the UK, and many many
  more privately owned cameras, which can be used by police forces in an
  investigation, public awareness campaigns around suspicious packages and
  ‘unusual behaviour’ were considered vital to enlist the public’s help in
  fighting terrorism. Is this what the public would expect civic duty and a
  shared responsibility for safety to look like? Or did it serve to arouse an
  atmosphere of fear and suspicion with little to no impact on safety?
