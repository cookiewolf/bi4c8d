      In October 2007, a junior official at His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs
      (HMRC) popped two unencrypted discs into an envelope and posted it to its
      intended destination at the National Audit Office. Somewhere between its
      collection in Washington, Tyne and Wear and the NAO in London, the discs
      went missing.


      On those unencrypted discs were information about 25 million legal UK residents, about 40% of the then population. Unless your parents were high earners, this means that if you lived in the UK and were under the age of 16 in 2007, or you were a parent of such a person, it’s likely that your data were on those discs.


      The loss of the discs was a national scandal that gained widespread public and media attention. An internal and Metropolitan Police investigation followed, as did several reports, including a government-commissioned report by PWC which labelled the loss as ‘avoidable’ and found ‘institutional deficiencies’ at HMRC. The loss was a wake-up call to implement more rigorous data security and handling measures in government, and raised serious questions about whether the public could trust the government to keep their data safe. It remains the largest known loss of data by any UK public institution.

      **3.31 pm, 20 November 2007 – House of Commons statement**


      The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Alistair Darling): With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement on the breach of procedures which led to personal data relating to child benefit from Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs going missing.


      I shall set out the nature of the data and the circumstances relating to how they went missing. However, it might be helpful to the House if I set out the background first. The National Audit Office, which is independent of Government but answerable to Parliament, has a right to ask for and access data from HMRC in discharging its compliance responsibilities.


      In March, it appears that a junior official in HMRC provided the National Audit Office with a full copy of HMRC’s data in relation to the payment of child benefit. In doing so, the strict rules governing HMRC standing procedures were clearly not followed. Those procedures relate to the security of and access to data as well as their transit to ensure that they are properly protected. That information should not have been handed over by HMRC in the way that it was. However, I understand that in this case the NAO subsequently returned all the information that it received in March to HMRC after auditing it.


      It now appears that, following a further request from the NAO in October for information from the child benefit database, again at a junior level and again contrary to all HMRC standing procedures, two password-protected discs containing a full copy of HMRC’s entire data in relation to the payment of child benefit were sent to the NAO, by HMRC’s internal post system operated by the courier TNT. The package was not recorded or registered. It appears that the data have failed to reach the addressee in the NAO.


      I also have to tell the House that, on finding that the package had not arrived at the NAO, a further copy of those data was sent, this time by registered post, which did arrive at the NAO. However, again HMRC should never have let that happen. Although it is believed that the data were sent from HMRC to the NAO on 18 October, the fact that they did not arrive was not reported to HMRC’s senior management until 8 November, nearly three weeks later.


      I was informed on Saturday 10 November and immediately instructed that comprehensive searches by customs officers be carried out on all premises where the missing data might be found. Those searches are continuing. I asked for an immediate investigation, which was initiated that weekend. I also insisted on immediate steps to prevent this from happening again. Action has been taken.


      On Monday 12 November, HMRC informed me that evidence might have been found of the route taken by the data and that they were likely to be found. However, by Wednesday 14 November it was clear to me that the HMRC searches had failed to find them. I therefore instructed the chairman of HMRC to call in the Metropolitan police to conduct a full investigation, in order to find the missing package. That investigation is still under way. Our priority was and is to find the data. Searches have been and continue to be carried out, including of HMRC and National Audit Office premises, and staff are being interviewed. So far, however, the missing data have not been found.


      The police tell me that they have no reason to believe that these data have found their way into the wrong hands. The police are not aware of any evidence that they are being used for fraudulent purposes or criminal activity.


      I will tell the House what is missing as a result of this extremely serious failure on the part of HMRC to protect sensitive personal data entrusted to it in breach of its own guidelines. In terms of protecting confidential data, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs is operationally independent of Ministers. It is established by statute and run by its chairman, Paul Gray, and a board of commissioners who are responsible for its operations but answerable to Parliament through me. Last week Paul Gray told me on his own initiative that given the seriousness of the operational failing he should resign. He has now confirmed that intention, and I am grateful to him for his contribution to the work of government, in HM Treasury, the Department for Work and Pensions and then HMRC.


      The missing information contains details of all child benefit recipients: records for 25 million individuals and 7.25 million families. Those records include the recipient and their children’s names, addresses and dates of birth, child benefit numbers, national insurance numbers and, where relevant, bank or building society account details. I regard this as an extremely serious failure by HMRC in its responsibilities to the public.


      In making this statement today, I have had to balance the imperative of informing the House and the public at the earliest opportunity with ensuring that when I did so the appropriate safeguards were in place to protect the public, including in relation to bank accounts. Indeed, the banks were adamant that they wanted as much time as possible to prepare for this announcement. I discussed the issue with the Information Commissioner on Thursday, who agreed that appropriate remedial action needed to be taken before a public statement was made. This action has now been taken. I have also sought the advice of both the Financial Services Authority and the Serious Organised Crime Agency, and other Departments have also been made aware of the issue.


      Let me set out what we have done. First, the UK Payments Association, the British Bankers Association and the Building Societies Association have been informed, and through them HMRC informed individual banks and other financial institutions, including building societies and post offices, of affected accounts. Secondly, individual institutions are flagging those accounts, which enables them continually to monitor for irregular activity. They tell me that so far they have found no evidence of such activity. Thirdly, individual institutions are also tracking back and analysing transactions on affected accounts to 18 October. Again, they have so far found no evidence of unusual activity. They will continue to monitor those accounts, so that if there is any suspicious activity, action can immediately be taken. Fourthly, if someone is an innocent victim of fraud as a result of this incident, people can be assured that they have protection under the banking code, so that they will not suffer any financial loss as a result.


      The UK Payments Association has confirmed that it is confident that every action has been taken by the banking industry to minimise the risk of any fraud. It has also confirmed that the missing data are not enough in themselves for someone to access a person’s bank account for fraudulent purposes, as additional security information and passwords are always required. However, we have to recognise the increased risk caused by these missing data. People will therefore want to monitor their accounts and guard against any unusual activity. The advice of banks is that there is no need for customers to ask for a new account or to contact their bank or building society. However, they should do what they should be doing in any event: checking their bank statements to keep a close eye on their account for any unusual activity; contacting their bank or building society immediately if they see anything in their statement that concerns them; and not giving out personal or account details requested unexpectedly by phone or e-mail. I reiterate that the banks have made it clear that individuals will not have to pay out for any loss in the event that they become the innocent victims of fraudulent activity. I can tell the House that child benefit payments will continue to be paid as before.


      There are already clear HMRC standing procedures, which appear to have been broken. HMRC has initiated changes to security processes and procedures, so they will now take place only with written authorisation from a senior manager and with appropriate protection for any transfer.


      The police investigation continues, although there is also likely to be an inquiry into the missing data by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which has responsibility for monitoring Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs. I have kept the Information Commissioner informed. It is highly likely that there have been breaches of the Data Protection Act, which the commissioner will investigate.


      The Government take the protection of personal data, in whatever form, extremely seriously and have therefore put in place and are strengthening rights and safeguards on the use and handling of such data. The Data Protection Act sets out the framework enforced by the Information Commissioner and the courts. Departments have specific controls on information sharing and duties of confidentiality that are being enhanced by amending the Data Protection Act to guard against misuse and provide further information to citizens about the information that the Government hold.


      …


      This is an extremely serious matter. HMRC has a responsibility towards the general public, who entrust it with highly sensitive personal information. It has failed to meet the high standards that should be expected of it. I recognise that millions of people across the country will be very concerned about what has happened. I deeply regret that and apologise for the anxiety that will undoubtedly be caused.


      But let me reiterate: there is no evidence that these data have reached the wrong hands and no evidence of fraud or criminal activity; banks and building societies are putting in place safeguards to protect people’s accounts; banks and building societies will continue to monitor those accounts; and no one will suffer any loss if they are innocent victims of fraud. I will, of course, keep the House updated of any further developments. I commend the statement to the House.

      The loss of two discs by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) started an
      intensive process as all Departments re-examined their practices:


      * The Cabinet Office (CO) has reviewed its internal security policies and procedures including those which specifically deal with the secure handling of information and protected personal data. The CO has ensured that these policies are compliant with the requirements of this report, specifically regarding limiting the use of removable media to the minimum necessary for business operation and providing encryption on any necessary non-encrypted media devices. A programme of encryption of all non-encrypted stand alone PCs used within the CO will be completed by the end of July 2008. Heads of business units in the Department have been asked to ensure and confirm that all their staff are aware of the existing policies and procedures which have been included in the Department’s own security manual. CO departmental data copying continues to be audited by an automated software product. The CO continues to monitor that its procedures and systems remain compliant with the Manual of Protective Security and any other centrally provided advice. An additional exercise is being undertaken immediately (the Omand Review) to ensure that the CO’s procedures, particularly concerning hard copy classified material, and the disposal of classified waste, are as effective as possible.

      * The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has reviewed and significantly changed write access to portable media. It is now only permissible to download data from the CPS system to portable media with the explicit permission of the IT Security Officer. An encryption programme for the hard drives of laptops containing personal data was completed by the end of May 2008. A review of back up tape procedures has taken place and written assurances that they are secure in transit and when stored has been provided by local managers. A Data and Information Integrity Audit has been completed with no significant issues being identified. Further work is on-going to assess and reduce risk and strengthen information risk governance, covering both personal data and other sensitive information. This will be completed during the next financial year utilising the ISO 27001 compliance programme.

      *  The Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) has undertaken an internal review to ensure best practice is understood across the BERR family and with delivery partners to ensure consistency and best practice in data handling security and management. Data governance arrangements have been strengthened with the appointment of senior civil service data owners. A network of Group Data Champions has also been established for liaison between the business, the data owners and BERR’s delivery partners (including NDPBs).

      * The Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) has completed a wide ranging review of security covering technology, culture, governance, data sharing procedures (including those of its delivery partners) and physical security. Deloitte has completed an independent review of the DCSF ContactPoint system. Both review reports show no obvious flaws in current systems and procedures, but have identified a number of opportunities for improvement. The new actions in this report are being implemented quickly in the Department. Strong controls remain in place covering the use of laptops and removable media. DCSF staff and partner organisations’ security responsibilities continue to be reinforced by the Permanent Secretary and through management action, stronger guidance, and training. DCSF’s governance framework is monitoring and ensuring progress and pace.

      * The Department for Communities and Local Government (CLG) has reviewed its processes and put in place a range of additional measures to further improve its data handling processes. Of particular note CLG has recently rolled out an updated Knowledge Management Strategy, including guidance on responsible data handling, to staff. Contractors and partners have been reminded of their responsibility in this area and the CIO has written to all his senior civil service colleagues. A new laptop solution has also been recently rolled out which is fully encrypted. Access policies to key systems with personal data on them have been reviewed and a code of conduct issued to all staff that have access to systems containing personal data. The wider Communities Group are carrying out similar activities with their staff and delivery partners. CLG will continue to lead and monitor this activity across the group to ensure that minimum requirements are always met or exceeded. Where potential risks have been identified either in the Group or with delivery partners remedial measures are being put in place. Communities and Local Government is working with the Local Government Association and the Cabinet Office to ensure local authorities have access to expert information assurance advice and best practice guidance is issued.

      * The Department for Culture, Media and Sport’s (DCMS) information management strategy is still under review. The area will shortly be considered by both the Audit Committee and the Department’s Board. Draft principles for ensuring that information assurance and business risk form part of the Department’s leadership culture have been published. Staff have been reminded of guidance and policies and an independent IT security audit has examined compliance. Encryption of laptops is underway, and completed for those that may be used for holding personal data. NDPBs have been informed of the new policy on the protection of data – DCMS will run a related seminar for NDPBs and delivery partners.

      * The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) has raised awareness of existing policies, procedures and good practice relevant to the use and storage of protected personal and other sensitive information. Staff across the DEFRA network have been reminded about their personal obligation to observe the existing guidance on handling information. This is being embedded through new information management accountabilities now being put in place, including a Board- level Senior Information Risk Owner and a network of Information Asset Owners. A Project on data handling procedures has been set up to deliver enhanced information assurance in DEFRA and its delivery network. A Project Board (consisting of representative key delivery bodies, business areas holding significant personal data and information risk experts) has been established to support the work to implement the requirements in the Data Handling Review. This includes ensuring appropriate accountabilities and responsibilities for information assurance; putting in place technical and other measures to ensure that protected personal and other sensitive information is adequately secured (including the roll out of a new fully encrypted laptop solution which will be completed by the end of 2008); and will also continue to review and improve, where necessary, existing security policies and procedures to ensure staff understand how data should be classified, stored, and handled.

      * The Department of Health (DH) has started implementation of the new actions in this report. Progress across the Department and its delivery bodies is being secured and monitored by a dedicated Programme Board. Reports on progress have been made to the Departmental Board and to the Audit Committee. Where the protections developed for use inside Government are not practicable for patient facing services within the NHS, work is in progress to ensure that equivalent safeguards are put in place. Full compliance will take some time, and must be achieved in a way that does not place patients at risk. For example the transmission of personal data to receiving A&amp;E units by ambulance crews needs to be made more secure but prevention of transmission in the interim would have been detrimental to patient care. Individual NHS Trusts have been asked to make a local judgement on the balance of risk to patient care against risk to personal data security in determining whether existing data sharing for particular purposes should continue whilst the steps required to secure data transfers are taken.

      * The Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (DIUS) adopted procedures from its two predecessor departments whilst developing its own approach. DIUS’s IT policy is standardised on laptops with full disc encryption, which places the Department in a strong position regarding information security. But DIUS commissioned an independent review in support of its data handling procedures. An implementation plan has been formulated allowing the development of Department- wide policies and procedures to meet the outcomes for this report, and good progress is being made. The DIUS Audit and Risk Committee has met to discuss information assurance issues, and will continue to take an active interest in this area. Furthermore, DIUS has held the first in a series of information assurance forums to enable its delivery partners to hear and share best practice from each other and from other experts. This is part of an ongoing dialogue with delivery partners to ensure an appropriate level of information assurance throughout the DIUS delivery chain.

      * The Department for International Development (DfID) achieved accreditation to ISO 27001 in March 2008. The Department does not hold large amounts of personal data relating to members of the public, it does hold significant volumes of commercial and security data. It takes a risk- based approach to information security and is reviewing its decisions on the controls over the storage, retrieval and transmission of all sensitive data.

      * The Department for Transport (DfT) announced in December a series of measures to improve the security of the personal information it holds. Since then, further progress has been made, including encryption of laptops, further replacement of discs with electronic transfer, new procedures on bulk transfer of forms and letters containing personal data, and work with IT suppliers to ensure systems and processes are robust and secure. Existing procedures have continued to be reviewed and improved, reflecting both internal lessons and the conclusions of this report.

      * The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has introduced improved controls over the physical transfer of data on removable media. These include the introduction of new more stringent procedures for Departmental staff and Service Providers, including refreshed guidance and a secure same-day courier service. All laptops in the Department have been replaced with fully encrypted laptops and non-encrypted devices are electronically barred from connecting to the network. DWP has introduced a fast-track project for the encryption of data transfers that cannot be done electronically. The Department has set up a dedicated project, led by a senior executive, to implement a number of other actions to improve data handling.

      * The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) issued reinforced instructions on data security and data protection issues to UKvisas staff in December 2007. New instructions on data handling and data security, in particular laptops and drives containing personal data, were issued in January and have been updated since. A centralised system for reporting incidents involving personal data has now been put in place. Additional guidance on the Data Protection Act, to emphasise and advise on its practical implications, has been circulated to the key units. As part of the FCO role in providing a global network for Government, FCO are undertaking a review of its worldwide mail services and will be acting on its recommendations.

      * The Home Office (HO), before the HMRC data loss, had already begun a review of its data security. This is being extended to take account of the issues arising from this report work. In parallel the HO has taken five further steps to tighten arrangements. New guidance has been issued to staff on the protective marking of documents and on their responsibilities under the Data Protection Act. Key data exchanges have been re-examined, with a view to increasing security. Data handling has been included in the compliance audit programme, to check that managers are following guidance. A new senior post has been created to support the SIRO and CIO on information management issues, including data handling procedures. Finally, the HO has established a new information assurance programme to ensure the implementation of the new mandatory minimum standards for the protection of personal data.

      * HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has continued to strengthen its data security arrangements since the Child Benefit data loss incident. It is co-operating fully with the external reviews, including the review by Kieran Poynter, and other investigations looking at the specifics of the incident, as well as wider data security issues. HMRC has taken significant steps to strengthen its data security arrangements in the short term and has now established and introduced a wide-ranging Departmental Data Security Programme to identify and drive forward delivery of further improvements in a structured way. This programme will incorporate any further work that may be required following receipt of the final Poynter Review report which is expected to be received in the first half of 2008 increased emphasis on compliance.

      * HM Treasury (HMT) is enhancing its staff education and training in security backed by senior management leadership and increased emphasis on compliance. In the light of the recent incident in which documents were lost, HMT has undertaken an immediate investigation and updated policies and procedures in light of the lessons learnt. The documents have been assessed to ensure that there was no breach of the Data Protection Act and there was no personal data associated with this incident.

      * The Ministry of Defence (MoD), following a loss of a laptop on 9 January 2008, commissioned an independent review by Sir Edmund Burton into the incident and lessons to be learned. Notwithstanding this review, the Chief of the Defence Staff and the Permanent Secretary have initiated a campaign across the Department to raise awareness as well as appointing a Departmental Head of Information Assurance and Data Protection. Further action has included: assigning responsibility for ensuring rigorous information assurance standards for systems outside the central accreditation and assurance system to the Departmental Security Officer; briefing information risk management to Integrated Project Team leaders; engaging with industry partners over the implications of this report; and putting in train the full-disc encryption of some 20,000 laptops across the Department. The Department is producing a consolidated programme to implement the recommendations of the Burton and Data Handling reviews.

      * The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) is continuing to make progress on all the actions identified in its December report. This includes ongoing communications to all staff about information management and security, launching a new Data Protection and Freedom of Information network, accompanied by new guidance about those Acts provisions and requirements, and work to review central induction and training programmes. Training delivery will reflect local solutions and included the roll-out from May 2008 of an on-line training package on security awareness and procedures in the National Offender Management Service (NOMS). A Ministry-wide information assurance programme is now in place to take forward implementation of the recommendations of this report.

      * The Northern Ireland Office (NIO) have completed a detailed review of their Data Handling and Information Assurance Policies and are satisfied that they comply with HMG policies/standards and ISO 27001. Policies will be continuously monitored to ensure compliance with any changes proposed or "lessons learnt" centrally. The Department has introduced new governance arrangements; an Accreditation Panel of key users and a Senior Risk Owners Council under the chairmanship of the SIRO have been established. The Department is complying with central guidance vis-à-vis removable media unencrypted laptops holding personal or protectively marked material. All staff in the NIO and satellite bodies are receiving refresher training for Data Handling and Information Assurance.
