After the attack, the Hackney Council pages to log in to pay rent and access my account weren’t responding. I couldn’t access my payment status or see how much I owed.I was sent letters that I was in arrears, the wrong amount. It wasn’t clear how much I owed and there was no timeline for it being fixed.
