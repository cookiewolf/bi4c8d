I work in a school and get paid only in term time. In the winter, I hit serious hardship. I borrowed money from a friend. I even looked into applying for bankruptcy. It was so stressful. My sleeping patterns became disrupted. I used to wake up at 3:30am unable to get back to sleep, and nap during the day because I couldn’t keep my eyes open any longer. It affected my health, it affected my relationships, and it affected my work. I used to miss work because of my health and sleep. If I couldn’t work, I wouldn't get paid. If I didn’t get paid, I couldn’t pay the rent, and the spiral continued.
