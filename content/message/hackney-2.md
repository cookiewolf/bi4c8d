Over a year after the attack, it still wasn’t always possible to make payments. By the time that they had settled on a figure, they said I owed £2,000. They wouldn’t send the calculation of this total, but they did send me threatening eviction letters and court letters, despite the fact that they said they wouldn’t be evicting anyone.
