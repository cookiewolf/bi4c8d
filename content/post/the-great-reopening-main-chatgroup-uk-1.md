The digital ID cards that were met with outrage in 2010 are being pushed through under the smoke screen of this pony pandemic. The contract has been awarded and details of the deal are stated on the stock exchange company bio. You will need one to work, claim benefits, travel, open a bank account, rent a property etc etc.. basically replacing all current forms of identifying yourself and will no doubt become a part in the health passport plan. If people can’t see what’s happening they might as well have their eyes closed.
