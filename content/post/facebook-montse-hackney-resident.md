Council is asking for rent arrears and I'm unable to access my account to check payments. Also, I contacted the council to get in the housing register and this is also not working.

Sometimes I think this hacking story is all made up to stop residents to access the council information. Hackney is not like other councils, there is no transparency, we don't have access to the council's meetings or decisions.
