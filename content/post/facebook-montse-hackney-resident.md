I am currently in the process of purchasing a flat in the council of Hackney, my offer was accepted back in August, as I imagine is common these days some things were delayed due to the pandemic but I have my mortgage offer and most of the solicitor's work is ready other than the local authority search.

The problem is that as some of you may know the Hackney Council was subject to a major cyber attack at the beginning of October which seems to have heavily impacted most of their infrastructure. Many of their services are currently heavily impacted by this, including the ability to perform local searches. Their latest on the subject seems to suggest this won't be resolved before March 2021, which would be terrible news for me because the stamp duty holiday might end by then, because my mortgage offer expires around that time, and because I can't stay in my current accommodation until then.
