absolute disgrace and blocking sale of Hackney homes. 2 MONTHS for a land search application (even submitted BEFORE your cyber attack) and all we get are automated replies, WHEN WILL THIS BE FIXED??

The council website has now been updated with a statement saying they are refunding search fees and are suggesting to take out search indemnity insurance. That might be the only option here it seems. Hackney Council are an absolute joke.

I cannot believe that EVERY sale in Hackney is on hold because of this! It’s peoples livelihoods at stake here. How did they do the searches before computers, surely there must be a manual way of doing it? Ridiculous.
