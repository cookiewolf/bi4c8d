Did you see the law they passed on the sly (not one mainstream media covered the news) Corona virus retention of DNA and fingerprints of anyone who is tested ( I don't know how the fingerprints tie in but they have covered it with this legislation)

It's there on the .gov website, they are keeping EVERYONE they tests DNA.

For national security! 

That's another reason they want everyone tested with these useless faulty tests
