How can we all be at risk of being forced to pay tens of thousands of pounds in SD when this is none of our faults! This is a bit of a nightmare.

Ready to exchange on our dream rural do-er up-er but stick with our (lovely) little Hackney flat! God first world problems ahoy, but still yes letâ€™s go and sob all over the town hall!! ðŸ¥‚ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

Phoned Hackney Council this morning and they said they have no time scale to restore land searches. "If it doesn't work this week try next week" Is what I was told. Can't believe there's no time scale at least.

Literally just â€˜if itâ€™s not available this week try next weekâ€™ ! I said - are we talking 6 months or a few weeks? She said I canâ€™t speculate. Iâ€™m pulling my hair out over here - what if we miss the stamp duty saving?! I then canâ€™t afford to move.
