title: Private lives are public record
---
Giving greater powers to authorities to reveal identities have been put forward by MPs over the years as a panacea policy solution for, amongst other issues: public safety concerns, hooliganism, terrorism, immigration and illegal work, online, electoral and financial abuse, data privacy concerns, social security fraud, and having to bring your passport to a nightclub. The skeptic may argue that if it is mooted by politicians as a solution for a profusion of issues, is it a solution in search of a problem?

The decades-long attempt to successfully introduce identity cards, either physical or digital, and the passing of the Investigatory Powers Bill in 2016 have cemented public distrust in any policy that wants to identify people in public domains – on the streets or online. In an age where personal data is valuable and coveted, and privacy is in short supply, there is fear that there are altogether more manipulative and underhand reasons for strengthening state surveillance capacity. In this context, it’s easy to see how when asked to use the NHS COVID-19 contact tracing app or enter a COVID-19 test result, there is hesitation or refusal.
