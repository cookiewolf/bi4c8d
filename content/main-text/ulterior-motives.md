title: Private lives are public record
---
Giving greater powers to authorities to reveal identities has been proposed by MPs over the years as a panacea policy solution for, among other issues: public safety concerns, hooliganism, terrorism, immigration and illegal work, online abuse, electoral and financial fraud, data privacy concerns, social security fraud, and daftness of having to bring your passport to a nightclub. A skeptic might argue that if politicians present it as a solution for a glut of different issues, is it a solution in search of a problem?

The decades-long effort to introduce identity cards, either physical or digital, and the passing of the Investigatory Powers Bill in 2016 have cemented public distrust in any policy aimed at identifying people in public domains, whether on the streets or online. In an age where personal data is valuable and coveted, and privacy is in short supply, there is fear that there are altogether more manipulative and underhand reasons for strengthening state surveillance capacity. In this context, itâ€™s easy to see how when asked to use the NHS COVID-19 contact tracing app or enter a COVID-19 test result, there is hesitation or refusal.
