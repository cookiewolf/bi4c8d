Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Christo Hall and Stuart Leech monitored UK-based anti-lockdown and anti-vax Telegram channels that were rife with mis- and disinformation. In the detail of these conversations, we found references to scandals and events in British history that appeared to be colouring and evidencing suspicion of authoritiesâ€™ pandemic responses.

Bifurcated (bi4c8d) documents some of those events, focusing on institutional privacy, security and surveillance controversies.

The project tries to understand how these events have contributed to the decline in institutional trust, and why the rabbit hole is overflowing.

Christo Hall is a writer, editor, MPP student of digital policy at McMaster University in Canada, AI governance researcher at the Centre for International Governance Innovation and former assistant editor of a global health journal.\

Stuart Leech is a UK-based artist who studied photography at the University of Portsmouth before turning to a multimedia and research-led approach to explore political and social issues.
