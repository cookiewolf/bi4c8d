title: Open government and open dialogue is critical to resurrecting trust
---
Though it feels like a lifetime ago, we are just four years on from the outset of the pandemic, and only a year since the WHO declared the global health emergency over. Through lockdowns, economic and trade shutdowns, access to care and education limitations, the rise of remote working, changes in habits and a whole lot more, the legacy of the pandemic will continue to be felt for many years to come. But what was its impact on trust? Studies have shown that political events create wild fluctuations in levels of trust and distrust (Reference), but the overall trend is a decline of trust in politicians, business, the media, and even in each other in the UK and in a significant number of other countries. According to the 2024 Edelman Trust Barometer, trust in the UK fell 4 percentage points last year and is now ranked among the least trusting countries in the world (Reference). In a survey by the Office for National Statistics, in answer to the question: ‘On a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is not at all and 10 is completely, how much do you trust Parliament (the House of Commons and the House of Lords)?’, the most common answer was ‘0’.

In this project, we have looked at several institutional privacy, security and surveillance policies and controversies mentioned by users of anti-lockdown and anti-vax Telegram channels. We have made the case that these events and controversies, and those like them, have built on the seeds of doubt of those who mis- and distrust. In many cases, it’s not just the event itself that has impacted trust, but related miscommunication, lack of transparency and accountability. What influences trust in politicians and in government is multifactorial and events and scandals are only one part of the picture. You could equally attribute the decline in trust to people’s opinion on society’s fairness, equality of opportunity, politicians’ broken manifesto commitments or the media’s role in influencing opinions. However, we wanted to dispel the myth that it’s only those on the fringe of society that hold distrustful opinions of our institutions. There is a danger that the majority of the population’s healthy mistrust topples over into cynicism if our institutions don’t take these events and the public response to them more seriously.

The idea for this project came to us when Prime Minister at the time, Boris Johnson, labelled anti-vaxxers ‘nuts’, while at the same time, the then French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron went further and said that he wanted to ‘piss off’ unvaccinated people. Such insensitive responses in political discourse condemns those who hold those opinions as irredeemable, especially when a great number of those who chose not to get vaccinated were not doing so because they had thoroughly evaluated the safety and efficacy of the vaccine (though they may have done so after to confirm that bias). A 2022 published study surveyed, amongst other things, why people chose not to get vaccinated. The most common response was ‘No reason/Don’t know’ (Reference). 

This project has framed faltering public opinions of government and public institutions as messages that they could do better, in all of the OECD’s competencies and values-led Drivers of Trust (Reference), and that politicians and the institutions they represent should not write off those who mistrust them as unreachable and unrepresentable. If that happens, the Donald Trumps of this world fill the void, the distrust spiral grows and the Internet rabbit holes deepen.
